## Quick start
The project uses the API https://geo.ipify.org/ which uses a key for authentication that can be obtained after registering in the API. For the correct operation of the project locally it is necessary to create the variable `REACT_APP_API_KEY` in the `.env` file that will receive as value the key obtained in ipify.

In the project directory:
